# Foldable Robotics Project: Basilisk-Inspired Robot

This repository contains all materials related to the **Foldable Robotics Project**, inspired by the basilisk lizard's unique ability to transition between quadrupedal and bipedal locomotion. The project focuses on designing and optimizing a foldable robotic system using a **four-bar mechanism** to enhance movement adaptability and efficiency.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to develop a robotic system capable of mimicking the basilisk lizard's terrestrial locomotion. By systematically altering the four-bar mechanism's parameters, the project aims to:

- Maximize the lift provided to the robot's body.
- Achieve efficient and stable motion transitions between locomotion modes.

This research contributes to the field of biomimetic robotics, emphasizing innovative, adaptable designs with potential applications in exploration, search and rescue, and entertainment.

## MuJoCo and Its Role

**MuJoCo (Multi-Joint dynamics with Contact)** is a high-performance physics engine used extensively in this project to simulate the robot's movements and dynamics. It was integral to:

- **Simulating Dynamics**: The four-bar mechanism and other robotic components were modeled and tested in a virtual environment to evaluate their stability and performance.
- **Optimizing Parameters**: MuJoCo allowed iterative testing of different configurations, such as link lengths, joint angles, and stiffness, to achieve optimal lift and balance.
- **Visualizing Movement**: The simulation provided visual feedback, enabling fine-tuning of parameters and validating the robot's locomotion design.

The XML templates used in MuJoCo defined the physical structure, joint properties, and other dynamic parameters of the robot. These simulations significantly reduced the need for physical prototyping, saving time and resources.
